Build Word2Vec Style Machine Learning Model to predict Images using Session Co-occurrence,"My website:
I run a search engine for images where users can also save images to collections. My website is identical to Pinterest.com.

Currently I have a Co-Occurrence Word2Vec based model that is based on the Image Id's found within the Collection: `[image_id_5, image_id_2, image_id_16, ...]. This list would contain all the ids within the collection and each collection would be grouped into a parent list—it's the same way you train Word2Vec normally (document -> sentence (collection_id) -> word (image_id).

Project:
When a user views an image, there is a feed of images shown below and my goal is to improve those results. To do this, I'm looking to utilize click tracking data per session and Collection Co-Occurrence data to build a retrainable model.

Collection Co-occurrence images are images that have also been saved to the same collection as the query image. These usually are always similar to the query image. 

Problem: 
The problem with my Collection Co-occurrence model is that the relatedness of the items are too narrow. By utilizing a trained model on both the Co-occurrence data AND Image_ids that are viewed within a user's session, there is a strong potential to improve the results.

Pinterest has accomplished this by using a user’s browsing session on Pinterest as the training data. Imagine each user session is a sentence with Image Ids as words. Basically if in a browsing session you visit pins A then B then C then D, it trains the network such that given A it predicts B, etc. This also helps capture semantic similarity.

NIST Handwriting recognition to CoreML,"Are you interested in a unique ML challenge, then you will love this project.

Apple iOS has made huge advancements with its CoreML model. And while it can reasonably detect handwriting digits using the MNIST dataset, there is no model available for handwriting character recognition. 

So we need one built.

Specifically, using the NIST Special 19 dataset (https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) and/or the IAM Handwriting dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/tejasreddy/iam-handwriting-top50), we want to create a CoreML model that can be used in an iOS application. 

This project is inspired by the work for Japanese character recognition (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-handwriting-recognizer-ship-it-to-app-store-fcce24205b4b/) and TejasReddy9 (https://github.com/TejasReddy9/handwriting_cnn)

Hence this project is fairly straight-forward; create the most accurate COREML module for English handwriting characters that we can integrate into our XCode project.

I am looking for a CCN code to recognize a new given image is a ""yes"" or ""no"".

I have already tried an implemented object detection code with a toutorial, I made a dataset with LabelIMG, and I trained a model, codes works well but doesn't give a good result on my images. 

I need to give a new image to the program an just recive if the image recognized as YES or NO.

You can use the exist and implemented codes such as Alexnet, any other ready stuff, your previuos jobs in deep learning or so!  

I have a really limited time and I need it till Monday morning. I have tried an exist code in half a day and I think for a person who has more knowledge in deep learning and programming, it is an easy job. 

I can Also help in labeling images for preparing dataset to save time.

Algorithm and Python Expert for Garment sizing recommendation,"We are a garment sizing recommendation software company based in Estonia and London. Our software is used by fashion retailers to give their customers a better decision on what size to purchase. Right now the app works purely using past shopper data and sizing feedback, no size charts required. 

We do not use any machine learning or advanced algorithms to make the sizing predictions, and therefore the current build has various weaknesses and can cause inaccuracies. We also do not utilise any external datasets. 
To improve the software and utilize machine learning to make more precise sizing recommendations, we are seeking a data scientist with python experience and general experience in solving similar situations to our use-case. 

To summarise what we do have and what we want:

We HAVE:
- Gender, height, weight, body shape, fit preference, age -  from previous customers
- Fit feedback on if the product they purchased fitted them or not. 

We DON'T have:
- Use of public datasets, such as:
https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation
https://github.com/rishabhmisra/Product-Catalog-Size-Recommendation-Framework

At the moment we are relying only on our own data from the specific retailers existing customer base. This means that we cannot give predictions on size until the product has a specific number of purchases from customers who provided their body data. We would like to combine datasets such as this one above in order to provide recommendations when we don't yet have purchase data. The question is, how can we utilise this public dataset in our use-case and combine it with our brand specific purchase data?

- Currently fit feedback has no impact on recommendations. The way we are generating recommendations is based solely on PHP now (finding close data within a specific height/weight range), not an ML model. 

- We do not have a model that can take garment measurements and predict sizing based solely on the garment measurements. See this article
https://tylerburleigh.com/blog/predicting-t-shirt-size-from-height-and-weight/

I would like to know if it is a viable option to create recommendations based on garment measurements provided by a specific retailer. OR should we stick to utilising clothing fit datasets like mentioned further up? What is the best way of cold starting a product size predictions? If a product has no purchase data, how should we generate recommendations - using the public purchase dataset, or by requesting garment measurements from the brand and utilising them in a model?

--------

We already had an ML model made by a data scientist using random forests and the problem we encounted is that if there was one row in the database where a customer provided fit feedback stating a product fitted them, it would generate a recommendation of 100% certainty that the new visitor should choose this size. It did not consider other close values. If there was only one entry for someone of the same height, weight with fit feedback of 'fitted' then ignoring other data. I understand this is how most algorithms work, but how to we solve this?

Before we hired this data scientist we heard about using recommendation models like LightFM, but in the end assumed this would not be suitable for our use case. Maybe we do infact need to use a similar model to this.

This project requires a data scientist to build a python-based classification model prototype that analyses value-based data and establishes features, feature sets, and output classification ranges across various dimensions. To begin, you will need a model to run feature calculations on the following features:
•	Time to peak
•	Max rate of change
•	Area under curve

You will then continue exploring the data and developing new relevant feature sets. 

We will provide positive and negative data samples for you to use, and you will then need to build a classification model that can distinguish between positive and negative samples.

This model will deliver results indicating classification type based on the values from the ingested data with high accuracy.  This model should run on all new inbound data received in our cloud, accepting payloads and outputting scored values. Outputs will be appended to existing record for review, analysis, and reporting. The model needs to be deployed and run on AWS infrastructure. 

Upon completion, the deployed model will automatically ingest, process new data samples received through a web app and stored in an AWS DB, outputting classification results. Results will enable classification/stratification into groups of cohorts, with additional values and indicators accessible and displayed. Ideally, the model shall train itself on all new samples.

Assess a student's motivation such as interest or boredom from data (educational data mining),"Many researchers in the fields of educational data mining and learning analytics focus on detecting motivation or engagement.

Motivation can be defined as a state of cognitive and emotional arousal, which leads to a conscious decision to act.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems attempt to motivate the student by using multimedia, games, etc. when students get bored or have difficulties to understand the current topics. This approach seems to be based on the idea that it is possible to diagnosis motivation and create instruction that is motivating learners.

Then how do we detect a person's motivation? 

Some relevant research on motivation diagnosis includes Self-report, Facial Emotion Recognition from student camera etc.

Nowadays it is possible to detect a student's level of motivation or engagement (an assess a level of motivational factors, such as curiosity, interest, tiredness, boredom and expectation plus the challenge of the task) by looking at patterns in the data due to the data collected from the e-learning system.

Advise Machine learning/Deep learning + Invoice,"Hello,
I search now, a freelance for some advises about machine learning/deep learning and asking price for an quote,

Questions :
- Machine learning start on data in entry and give result/output and learn with conditions write in code ?
- For the next simulations/training, algorithm can start with before good result ?
- We can give define result and he need to learn how to output this ?

For the quote:
I have several series of numbers, I would like, thanks to machine learning, to be able to guess the next line,
if the algorithm does not arrive there (gives a false result), give it the result which should have had, learn how to get there and start again with this line (which is right) by comparing with that below until the last ...

Objective: '' '' understand the algorithm '' '' by numbers !!
These series of numbers are generated by various algorithms (php, excel, python, javascript, ....).
These numbers have no meaning, like the idea which has very little use but it makes me laugh, so I do!

-So why is it better machine learning or deep learning?
-I wish that at the end of the numbers, at the end of the list, he gives me a prediction and does not pass on, is it possible?
-If we stop training, can we resume afterwards?
-Is it possible to add a sensor which estimates how many% it is relevant?
-Is it possible to add data once finished? (and with this framework, https://github.com/creme-ml/creme?)
-With over 1500 sets of numbers, is that enough for learning? It is necessary to run the h24 program? with what computer power?
-Is it possible to make sure that there is learning with little data?

How much did you offer me for that?

Python developer needed for Listrak integration using REST,"We're looking for an experienced Python developer to take over an API project underway. The internal resource assigned to the project no longer has availability to complete this on time, but will remain as the main contact for the project.

The project involves interfacing with a SQL Server database to extract information, in this case the DB is Microsoft NAV so relevant experience a huge plus. The Python program will then compile the necessary information from the database in one of a number of potential ways, manipulate it, and send it via REST API to the email marketing platform Listrak. There may also be other online resources that need pulled in to fully compile the information sent via API.

The project is well underway and hosted on Bitbucket. The work of establishing a connection to the Listrak API by securing an Oauth2 token has already been done (using Python modules requests and requests-oauthlib). What remains is pulling in a secondary online source to round out the information pulled from the NAV database, much of which is also already complete.

The largest pure Python issue to tackle is pulling the necessary information from the data sources and sending it in the proper format to Listrak via API. A knowledgeable and well-versed contact will be able to assist and answer questions 24/7 so this should be a pretty straight forward project that could lead to much more.

Also to be done would be setting up the method by which database information is pulled and refreshed . There are several possible ways to do this and it might not necessarily be done with Python.

Urgent Python Developer needed,"We have an android app whose backend is on laravel. 
One of the fuctionality is that every user has its own scannable code. 
The scannable code generation and scanning of the code will be done on the python side. 
I need the python SDK/scripts to be copy rights free, please makesure all the call backs are removed from the code, all the libraries should be renamed and the functions names should be changed etc, so that copy rights issue can be resolved. 
The python scripts will be deployed on aws server, laravel code is already there and it should be connected with the python scripts.
I think it should work like: 
Whenever a user is created from android app, api will be called to the backend laravel, and from laravel the scripts should be called to generate the code and scan it.
There will be 2 apis on the python side:
One for the code generation and other for the scanning module. 
Whenever the scanning api will be called, it will open the scanning on the android side. 

Please make sure it works fine and there is no issue of the copy rights as we have to publish it on the android play store, there are many templates in the python module, i will tell you the template and color of the code.

AWS Architecture and Cloud Infrastructure Recommendation and Strategy,"We [company] wish to engage an Amazon Web Services consultant/firm to enhance our AWS instance [COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM] and those instances that serve Company clients.  Our goal is to minimize ongoing costs, streamline delivery of software and ensure our data science team is provided the support needed to work efficiently within R and other tools used for data analysis. 


Our PLATFORM is an Angular & Python-based web application over Django with PostgreSQL and MongoDB backends and an R Server with RStudio. Source code resides in Bitbucket and TeamCity is used for CI/CD.

Strategic Consulting Engagement Overview 
 
This involves three significant changes and improvements that are described below.

Part 1 - Streamline provisioning of environments using Terraform
Implement for  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM Terraform Infrastructure-as-code (IaC).This will enable Company to create system environments (for development, test, customers, etc.) faster and in a uniform fashion. Consultant will build Terraform configurations for the environments using best practices including Terraform modules. One module will be developed for standard infrastructure, and each environment will be an implementation of that module through template files called configurations.  The module will be flexible to allow for an environment to have different or additional infrastructure. Upon completion of this work, Company will have the ability to create environments through Terraform commands and will no longer have to perform this work manually using the AWS console.




Part 2 - Containerize  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM and serve the application with Elastic Container Service (ECS)
Consultant shall containerize The  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application, which will be served by the AWS Elastic Container Service.  This will increase fault tolerance and improve the probability of maintaining superior uptime.  Consultant will create a Dockerfile which is the blueprint of the  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application which will be used by the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) to serve the application. The ECS configuration will be in the Terraform module created in the first work item described above. This will reduce the effort involved in deploying the  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application and increase uptime by allowing the application to automatically recover from failures. Upon successful completion of this work, Company will be able to create a customer environment, including the  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application, using only Terraform commands.


Part 3 - Configure automatic deployments via TeamCity CI/CD pipelines
Consultant shall enable the automatic deployments of  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM, which will be configured to reduce the time and effort required by Company developers to deploy  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM. Consultant will build a CI/CD pipeline in TeamCity which will build the  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application, run tests (if any), and deploy change to customer environments as may be required for existing client environments or to enable environments for new clients. Upon successful completion of this work, Company will be able to make a change to the  COMPANY SAAS PLATFORM application code and see it in a live environment shortly after.

Complete Marketing Plan for B2C Mobile App,"We're an education technology startup on the app store. We are a market place for college students to list and rent notes from each other. We also help college students finish their homework assignments. 
We are currently looking for someone to put together a marketing plan, there will be more work as we test out your plan. 

Must be experienced in excel, if you can analyze data using python or R that's a big plus and I will have a lot more work for you. 

You will have access to me for any questions. 

Heres what the plan will consist of: 

1. Market research. Research is the backbone of the marketing plan. Your local library is a great place to start, offering reports like Standard & Poors or IBISWorld. Some library cards even allow access to online services from home. Identify consumer buying habits in the industry, market size, market growth or decline, and any current trends.

2. Target market. A well-designed target market description identifies your most likely buyers. In addition, you should discuss at least two or three levels of segmentation. A language tutoring business might target both students and foreign-born employees who want to improve their English.

3. Positioning. What is the perception of your brand in the marketplace? For example, if your restaurant sells burgers, do customers see you as the place to go for gluten-free or healthy options or the place to go if you’ve got an appetite for a double cheeseburger? The difference in how the target market sees you is your positioning. Develop compelling branding and marketing messages that clearly communicate how you want to be perceived.

4. Competitive analysis. You need to know who your competitors are and how your products and services are different. What is the price point at which your competitors are selling, and what segment of the market are they aiming to reach? Knowing the ins and outs of your competitors will help you better position your business and stand out from the competition.

5. Market strategy. Your marketing strategy is your path to sales goals. Ask yourself “How will I find and attract my most likely buyers?” This is the core of what the strategy should explain. It should look at the entire marketplace and then break down specific tactics including such as events, direct mail, email, social media, content strategy, street teams, couponing, webinars, seminars, partnerships, and other activities that will help you gain access to customers.

6. Budget. Develop a month-by-month schedule of what you plan to spend on marketing. Also include a “red light” decision point. For each activity, establish a metric that tells you to stop if it’s not generating sufficient return on investment (ROI).

7. Metrics. Track your marketing success with Google Analytics for website conversions and a simple Excel sheet to compare your budget against the actual ROI. Test programs over the course of a 30- to 60-day period, and evaluate the results. Repeat any programs that are delivering sales or sign-ups to your email list, and get rid of anything that’s not.",100,Open,Sales & Marketing,Marketing Strategy,Fixed,http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0189da133775e18eea,2020-02-21T04:39:08+0000,~0189da133775e18eea,python; growth-strategy; customer-acquisition-strategy; content-marketing; direct-marketing; marketing-management; b2c; startup-company; influencer-marketing; data-analytics; social-media-marketing; outreach-strategy; budgeting; go-to-market-strategy; email-marketing; market-analysis,4.6706727746,5,19,17,United States

Developer to resolve issues with Python CloudCode in a Firebase project,"We have a project in Firebase that uses Cloud Functions to perform a series of tasks in Python. We have a cron (Google Scheduler) that I need some small changes to better handle performance and a new function created that's triggered when a new document is saved.  

+The App
The app we've created allows people to track activities on their Apple Watch and have them automatically sync to Firebase and then saved within Firebase Firestore. We track the calories in these activities and then total it up with their friends to work towards weekly goals. If they hit the goal they're rewarded. 

+Update the Cron
With the Cron task, every 5 minutes it goes through every team saved within Firestore and performs a number of tasks including:
- Recalculation of the total calories for that week.
- Checking if the goal has been achieved and notify everyone
- Checking if the timer has expired and notifying everyone.
- Etc 
Now that we've been running for a few weeks this task is taking 80 seconds to complete rather than the 1-2 seconds it did when we were in Beta. Currently it parses EVERY challenge, regardless of when it started so we need better queries added to the cron to bring this back down to 1-2 seconds (i.e. only look at active challenges)

+New cloud function. 
We need to add another cloud function that's triggered when a new activity (workout) is saved from a user's phone (i.e. a new activity document is saved in Firestore). When it is, we need it to:
- Find any active challenges the user is part of (can be 1 or many). 
- Make sure the activity hasn't been logged already (de-duplication). 
- Create a new Firestore document in each of the challenges they're part of.  
- Recalculate the total for the challenges the user is part of. 
- Run the Cron (listed above) to check if the challenge has been completed and action it accordingly. This includes sending push notifications, setting values in the challenge object.

Developer needed to create a minor POC on a blockchain-enabled drug traceability solution,"**Job Description**: A developer is needed to come up with a product called Medikisha Dawa, a pharmaceutical supply chain solution that focuses on delivering a blockchain enabled drug traceability solution for manufacturers. 

**Scope of Work**: The solution focuses on a typical medicine manufacturer's supply chain.

**Users**: Manufacturer, Wholesaler,Retailer and Consumer.

**Detailed Description of Solution**:
The blockchain enabled drug traceability solution focuses on a single manufacturer’s use case. The manufacturer has clients who consist of wholesalers and retailers. The wholesalers and retailers are registered to the blockchain by the manufacturer. Once the registration of the actors is done, the wholesaler is assigned a unit of medicine by the manufacturer. The wholesaler later on transfers the same unit of medicine to the retailer. The transfer of units of medicine is registered in the blockchain.
Once the retailer is in receipt of the unit of medicine from the wholesaler, the customer on time of purchase is able to know the source of the drug by scanning the bar code/QR code on the medicine’s casing. The information displayed will relay the handlers of the drug down the supply chain. In the event of rogue drugs, the customer is prompted to report the illegitimate drug.

**Main Objective**: 
The main objective of the job is to come up with a solution that consists of a web app enabled front end that runs its business logic/transactions on a blockchain environment (preferably Hyperledger Sawtooth Lake). The solution should enable the end user (consumer) to be able to trace the origin of the drug once they scan a QR/Bar Code at the time of purchase of the drug.

We need to create a Python service that is syncing data between a Marketing Automation system and a survey system. Both services have REST APIs.

- Person and campaign needs to be extracted from the REST API of the Marketing Automation system at regular intervals and then inserted into a survey system. The campaign data from the Marketing Automation system needs to be cached temporarily (Redis) to save some unnecessary REST API calls for subsequent requests.
- All previously fetched people from the Marketing Automation system then need to be saved in the survey system. Afterwards, survey data for these people needs to be retrieved from the survey system and saved in the Marketing automation system.
- This process needs to repeat every hour.
- The service also needs to allow one incoming HTTP POST request from the survey system (webhook). For every incoming request, the POST data needs to be saved in the Marketing Automation system

DevOps / Database Architect to consult and help build a high-load data processing system (5TB+/day),"We are looking for an experienced DevOps specialist with significant experience in PSQL / MySQL, Mongo / SOLR setup to propose an architecture for a data intensive process. We are looking for people having experience having built systems capable of injecting 10TB+ daily. 
All to be hosted on AWS (although we are open to using rented servers).

Requirements:
A python process will preprocess and import XML files multiple times per day. The size of these files can be between 50MB and 10GB. The size of each document is between 10-50KB and has between 15 and 30 fields, text.
The system must be capable of importing files once per hour and there are about 20-30 files in total. In general, we expect the total volume of all XML-Files that have to be imported and updated once per hour to be around 100GB. The total number of unique documents thus varies between 10 and 50 million. 
Once the import is completed, the documents have to be synched to an internal database, that is used by our web application. Our web application receives about 100K requests/day for these documents and is using Django Rest as backend and React as front-end to serve these documents.
All documents have to be synched in parallel to a SOLR Cluster that is being used for the search functionality of the front-end application. The SOLR cluster will receive between 5 and 10 million requests per day.

A more detailed data flow will be provided during the interview.

Our current tech stack is MongoDB, PSQL, SOLR, Python and Django Rest for Backend. 

Additional requirements: 
Our budget expectations for this system is around $1,5K/month. We would prefer AWS but are also open to using rented machines for databases if needed. 

Deliverables:
For this project to be successful, we expect the following milestones to be completed:

What I want to know is the reason why OpenCV is able to grab the video file that I use,instead the OpenPose addon is not able to do that.
